This repository provides a practical implementation for evaluating the techno-economic viability of coherent Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP) fronthaul architectures in future mobile networks. The code models network topologies, calculates the required network equipment and associated power consumption, and compares Point-to-Point (P2P), WDM, and P2MP solutions in terms of cost and energy efficiency.

The methodology and results are detailed in the following article:

Available: https://opg.optica.org/abstract.cfm?uri=Networks-2025-NeW4B.3

The code is written in Python and designed for reproducible techno-economic simulations based on realistic deployment scenarios. Key features include configurable traffic models, optical equipment catalogues, and cost/power evaluation modules.
